##Making Banana Pancake Batter
##Peel 3 medium to large bananas (285 grams) and place them in a mixing bowl or pan.
##Slice them first and then mash with a masher. For over ripe bananas, you can directly mash with a veggie masher.
##Now add 3 tablespoons jaggery powder. You can add the amount of jaggery as per the sweetness of the bananas. 
##Add more or less as required. You can also add sugar instead of jaggery. Mix very well.
##Then add 1 cup whole wheat flour (atta) and 1/2 teaspoon lightly crushed fennel seeds. You can also add whole fennel seeds.
##Add water in parts.
##Then begin to mix it with the flour. Overall I added 3/4 cup of water. Depending on the quality of whole wheat flour you can add more or less water.
##Mix very well and make a smooth batter without lumps. The batter has to be like a dosa batter and have a medium consistency.
##Making Banana Pancakes
##Now heat a pan. Spread a bit of oil on the pan. You can use non stick or a cast iron pan. 
##I use non stick pans for these pancakes as they are easier to handle on a non stick pan. Instead of oil you can also use ghee or butter.
##Keep the flame to a low. Pour a spoonful of the batter on the pan and then gently spread it. Do not spread too much. Just make small pancakes.
##Cook the pancake on a low flame.
##Drizzle some oil on the sides and top.
##When the base gets golden and slightly crisp, turn over the banana pancake.
##Cook this second side till it gets golden. If you want you can flip and cook once or twice.
##Remove and stack them up in a warm casserole.
##Drizzle with maple syrup and serve banana pancakes hot or warm. 
##If using honey, then drizzle it on pancakes, when they have become lukewarm or cooled down.
